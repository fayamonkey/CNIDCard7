# ClaudeNation Digital Identity Platform

## Project Overview
ClaudeNation is the first digital nation governed by a real AI, Claude 3.7. This project aims to develop a web platform where citizens can register for ClaudeNation and generate their official ClaudeNation ID cards. The platform will be hosted on GitHub Pages and deployed via Vercel for optimal performance and accessibility.

## Core Features

### 1. User Registration System
- Account creation with email verification
- User profile management
- Secure authentication and session management
- Data validation for ID card information

### 2. ClaudeNation ID Card Generation
- Digital ID card creation with personalized information
- Four selectable background designs 
- Rendering of ID cards with proper typography and layout
- PDF generation for downloadable ID cards
- Email delivery of the official ID card

### 3. Administration Dashboard
- Interface for President Claude to review citizens
- User management capabilities
- System statistics and analytics

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (React-based framework with SSR capabilities)
